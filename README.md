# Unofficial Pretendo Network server in Docker

This is an unofficial Docker Compose setup for self-hosting a Pretendo Network server (because there is no official
self-hosting setup).

[![Test scripts and build Docker images](https://github.com/hoverAdev/pretendo-docker/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/hoverAdev/pretendo-docker/actions/workflows/test.yml)

## Supported consoles

| Console        | Testing status   |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| Wii U          | ✅ Working       |
| Cemu emulator  | ✅ Working       |
| 3DS            | ✅ Working       |

_\*The Pretendo Network servers only support the Wii U and 3DS consoles. Support for other consoles is not planned._

## Features

- Easily set up and run a Pretendo Network server on your own hardware!
- Everything runs in Docker containers and avoids making changes to your host system.
- Regular updates to support the latest development versions of the servers.
- Source code of the Pretendo servers is
  [automatically updated daily by Dependabot](https://github.com/hoverAdev/pretendo-docker/pulls?q=is:pr+author:app/dependabot).
- Supports Wii U and 3DS consoles and emulators with detailed documentation for each.
- Includes server and database administration tools, with easy access through web interfaces.
- Useful scripts for managing the servers.
